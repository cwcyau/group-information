## About Me

### Responsibilities 

### Internal and external roles

As a senior academic, I have a number of university and national roles which occupy a significant portion of my time. This currently includes a formal commitment of a 30% secondment to Health Data Research UK where I serve as Deputy Programme Director for Capacity Building.
