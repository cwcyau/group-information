# Supervision Information

## General approach

I principally see my relationship with students and postdocs as *collaborative* and a *learning experience* we are working in partnership to achieve the following:

1. Do interesting science.
2. To learn new skills.
3. To develop your research autonomy and independence.
4. To further your career ambitions.

In order to allow this development, I will typically afford you considerable freedom and independence to structure your work and to decide your own path. As a result, the group often works on a variety of problems using many different techniques and methodologies.

Note, in the case of postdocs, there maybe some limitations imposed by the source of funding providing the position but these would be discussed when you start your role.

## Expectations of you

You are therefore expected to manage your own time *effectively* but I will expect you to adopt the following practices:

1. Document your research regularly.
2. Utilise your flexible working hours respectfully and do work consistently.
3. 

## Expectations of me

As a senior academic, I have a number of university and national roles which occupy a significant portion of my time. This currently includes a formal commitment of a 30% secondment to [Health Data Research UK]() where I serve as Deputy Programme Director for Capacity Building.
