# Supervision Information

I principally see my relationship with students and postdocs as *collaborative* and we are working in partnership to achieve one or more of the following:

1. Do interesting science.
2. To learn new skills.
3. To further your career ambitions.

Note, in the case of postdocs, there maybe some limitations imposed by the source of funding providing the position but these would be discussed when you start your role. 

## Internal and external roles

As a senior academic, I have a number of university and national roles which occupy a significant portion of my time. This currently includes a formal commitment of a 30% secondment to Health Data Research UK where I serve as Deputy Programme Director for Capacity Building.
