# Research Group Handbook

The following provides some information about the group and how it works. The group is administered via the Nuffield Department for Women's and Reproductive Health (NDWRH) but physically based in the Big Data Institute (BDI) where we rent space.

## Group members

The current members of the group are:

|Role|Name|Location|

## Working Information

### Office and Remote Working

We have six desks in the BDI, four in a closed office space on the ground floor and two hot desks immediately outside.

The office occupiers are currently:

1. Ellen Visscher
2. Natalia Hong
3. Charles Gadd
4. Sara Matijevic

Desk allocations are reviewed periodically to maximise their use/occupancy. The lack of occupancy could result in the removal of space from the group so this is something that we collectively should be aware of.

Many group members work remotely and the two hot desks provide space for when you need to be based in BDI.

I work remotely a lot myself so I may request meetings at a location in Central Oxford instead of the BDI depending on personal scheduling.

### Working Hours

Group members are expected to manage their own working hours. However, there is a reasonable expectation that you would be available for meetings between 09:00 and 17:00 from Mondays to Fridays with 24 hours prior notice. As long as group members make individual progress with their work, you will be given flexibility to manage your own time.

Managed working hours will only be used where suitable and sufficient progress is not being made with your work.

### Group Calendar

There is a Google-based group calendar where I will add key dates and activities. You can also add your own information (e.g. absences) to this calendar.

### Leave of absence

**Postdocs** should formally apply for their annual leave in TeamSeer.

If you are taking a pre-planned leave of absence, you can provide this information in advance in the group calendar. 

If you need to take that immediate time away (e.g. illness, bereavement), please notify me via e-mail or Slack where that is practical.

### University-related travel

If you are travelling on university-related business, please note that the university has certain restrictions and processes in place particularly related to travel outside of the UK. 

NDWRH has step-by-step instructions on its [Booking a Trip](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/NDWR-NDWRHIntranet/SitePages/Booking-a-Trip.aspx) intranet page. 

### Travel Expenses

If you incur any expenses (e.g. food, travel) during your travels, you may reclaim these costs typically up to a certain daily limit set by the university. You can find information on the University [Claimants Guide](https://finance.admin.ox.ac.uk/travel-expenses-claimants-guide). The University [eExpenses system](https://finance.admin.ox.ac.uk/eexpenses-system).

For further details, consult the [NDWRH Intranet](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/NDWR-NDWRHIntranet).

### Research Expenses

The group generally has access to extensive financial resources and individual members may have access to exclusive funds for equipment and other research expenses. Ask Chris for more details if you need to make any purchases. **Please note that university suppliers can be very, very slow.**

## Ways of working

### Meetings

For members where I am primary supervisor or line manager, the meeting frequently is typically once per week. Frequency will be adapted based on status and progress of research accordingly so meetings for senior students and postdocs, who are more independent, maybe reduced to once every two weeks. For co-supervised members, meeting frequency will be made consummate with my general contribution to your supervision.

### Documentation

Regular documentation of your research is vital as it helps me to follow your progress and answer questions you may have inbetween face-to-face meetings. 

#### Google Doc Logs

Each member of the group will have a Google Doc-based log. This is where you should routinely provide updates on your work and progress (including links to any external materials).    You can leave questions for me within these documents. These will be regularly checked and commented on. 

#### Overleaf

For mathematical work, we will use shared Overleaf documents to enable collaborative. Manuscripts will typically be written in the form of Latex documents unless journal choice mandates the use of Microsoft Word.

#### Code repositories

You are advised to regularly store program codes and scripts in a code repository (e.g. Github).

### Slack

There is a Group Slack channel for instant messaging style communications. Use this to ask quick questions or drop me a thought that I can pick up later. However, if it is important, use your Google Doc as Slack messages will not be permanently stored.

### High-performance computing

The group has a share on the [BMRC](https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/for-staff/resources/bmrc) facility and group members can be added to access the system.

## New Starters

### Buildings access

Access to the building is controlled via your University Card. To enable card access to BDI, please request that BDI Reception add you to their access database (you may need Chris to email them first). 

There is a regular BDI Building Safety Induction, please ask BDI Reception to book you into the next available one.

24 hour access to BDI is only available to those who have completed the Building Safety Induction.

### Information Security

The University has a mandatory [Information Security](https://www.infosec.ox.ac.uk/training-and-awareness) Training requirement. Students and staff should complete the training and maybe required to repeat this annually.
