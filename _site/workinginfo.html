<h2 id="working-information">Working Information</h2>

<h3 id="office-and-remote-working">Office and Remote Working</h3>

<p>We have six desks in the BDI, four in a closed office space on the ground floor and two hot desks immediately outside.</p>

<p>The office occupiers are currently:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ellen Visscher</li>
  <li>Natalia Hong</li>
  <li>Charles Gadd</li>
  <li>Sara Matijevic</li>
</ol>

<p>Desk allocations are reviewed periodically to maximise their use/occupancy. The lack of occupancy could result in the removal of space from the group so this is something that we collectively should be aware of.</p>

<p>Many group members work remotely and the two hot desks provide space for when you need to be based in BDI.</p>

<p>I work remotely a lot myself so I may request meetings at a location in Central Oxford instead of the BDI depending on personal scheduling.</p>

<h3 id="working-hours">Working Hours</h3>

<p>Group members are expected to manage their own working hours. However, there is a reasonable expectation that you would be available for meetings between 09:00 and 17:00 from Mondays to Fridays with 24 hours prior notice. As long as group members make individual progress with their work, you will be given flexibility to manage your own time.</p>

<p>Managed working hours will only be used where suitable and sufficient progress is not being made with your work.</p>

<h3 id="group-calendar">Group Calendar</h3>

<p>There is a Google-based group calendar where I will add key dates and activities. You can also add your own information (e.g. absences) to this calendar.</p>

<h3 id="leave-of-absence">Leave of absence</h3>

<p><strong>Postdocs</strong> should formally apply for their annual leave in TeamSeer.</p>

<p>If you are taking a pre-planned leave of absence, you can provide this information in advance in the group calendar.</p>

<p>If you need to take that immediate time away (e.g. illness, bereavement), please notify me via e-mail or Slack where that is practical.</p>

<h3 id="university-related-travel">University-related travel</h3>

<p>If you are travelling on university-related business, please note that the university has certain restrictions and processes in place particularly related to travel outside of the UK.</p>

<p>NDWRH has step-by-step instructions on its <a href="https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/NDWR-NDWRHIntranet/SitePages/Booking-a-Trip.aspx">Booking a Trip</a> intranet page.</p>

<h3 id="travel-expenses">Travel Expenses</h3>

<p>If you incur any expenses (e.g. food, travel) during your travels, you may reclaim these costs typically up to a certain daily limit set by the university. You can find information on the University <a href="https://finance.admin.ox.ac.uk/travel-expenses-claimants-guide">Claimants Guide</a>. The University <a href="https://finance.admin.ox.ac.uk/eexpenses-system">eExpenses system</a>.</p>

<p>For further details, consult the <a href="https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/NDWR-NDWRHIntranet">NDWRH Intranet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="research-expenses">Research Expenses</h3>

<p>The group generally has access to extensive financial resources and individual members may have access to exclusive funds for equipment and other research expenses. Ask Chris for more details if you need to make any purchases. <strong>Please note that university suppliers can be very, very slow.</strong></p>
