<h2 id="foundations-of-machine-learning">Foundations of Machine Learning</h2>

<p>I am generally interested in how to build machine learning (ML) models with more <em>realistic</em> underlying assumptions for applied scientific applications. A general feature of machine learning development is that it is often undertaken by individuals who have had very little background in applied sciences. As a consequence, ML methods can often be somewhat divorced from their potential real world use by stylising the problem into a form which is mathematically or computationally convenient and elegant but not practicable for the end-users. Implicit assumptions can also be made which are unrealistic, e.g. the amount of available data or assuming that the model can be used independently of human decision making.</p>

<h3 id="feature-interpretability">Feature-interpretability</h3>

<p>In the biological sciences, molecular tools are used to probe cellular and physiological machinery to understand their normal, diseased and perturbed (e.g. genetic modification, chemical stimulation) behaviours.</p>

<h3 id="stability-of-machine-learning-models">Stability of machine learning models</h3>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Let $X$ denote an input and $Y$ denote an output and assume a function $f_\theta$ parameterised by $\theta$ links input and output via the relationship $Y = f_\theta(X) + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is iid noise. Given data $D = {{x_1, y_1}, \dots, {x_n,y_n}}$, learning corresponds to finding $\hat{theta}$ (or a distribution over $p(\theta</td>
      <td>D)$ in a Bayesian setting) that minimises an empirical loss function $L_\theta(D)$:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

\[\hat{\theta} = \arg \min_{\theta} L_\theta(D)\]

<p>The performance of the model depends on three key things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The detailed specification of $f_\theta$, e.g. is it linear? is it a neural network?, and its capacity to flexibly model different relationships including the <em>unknown</em> but true function (<strong>model specification</strong>).</li>
  <li>Our ability to learn $\hat{\theta}$ to identify that true function given data (<strong>optimisation</strong>).</li>
  <li>The representative of the data $D$ of the test time data distribution (<strong>predictive capability</strong>).</li>
</ol>

<p>The stability of a model refers to whether (potentially small) deviations in model parameters or data distribution could cause the model to give wildly different predictions.</p>

<p>That is, if $y_1 = f_\theta(x)$ and $y_2 = f_{\theta’}(x)$, where $\theta’ = \theta (1 + \delta)$, if the distance between the outputs $d(y_1, y_2) \gg 0$ when $\delta \ll 1$ then the model is considered to be <em>unstable</em> with respect to its parameters (which could be due to either model misspecification or poor optimisation).</p>

<p>Similarly, if $y_1 = f_\theta(x_1)$ and $y_2 = f_{\theta}(x_2)$, where $x_1 \sim Q_1$ and $Q_2 \sim H_2$ and $H_1$ and $H_2$ are two input distributions, if the distance between the outputs $d(y_1, y_2) \gg 0$ when the distance between input distributions $h(Q_1,Q_2)$ then the model is considered to be <em>unstable</em> with respect to its input distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Research Problem</strong> Unstable machine models are problematic in critical applications, such as in medical devices, can we build machine learning models with <em>built-in</em> mechanisms to minimise instability from the outset?</p>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong> Medical devices based on provably stable machine learning models are better candidates for regulatory approval than those where there are no stability guarantees.</p>
