### Buildings access

Access to the building is controlled via your University Card. To enable card access to BDI, please request that BDI Reception add you to their access database (you may need Chris to email them first). 

There is a regular BDI Building Safety Induction, please ask BDI Reception to book you into the next available one.

24 hour access to BDI is only available to those who have completed the Building Safety Induction.

### Information Security

The University has a mandatory [Information Security](https://www.infosec.ox.ac.uk/training-and-awareness) Training requirement. Students and staff should complete the training and maybe required to repeat this annually.
