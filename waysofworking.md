## Ways of working

### Meetings

For members where I am primary supervisor or line manager, the meeting frequently is typically once per week. Frequency will be adapted based on status and progress of research accordingly so meetings for senior students and postdocs, who are more independent, maybe reduced to once every two weeks. For co-supervised members, meeting frequency will be made consummate with my general contribution to your supervision.

### Documentation

Regular documentation of your research is vital as it helps me to follow your progress and answer questions you may have inbetween face-to-face meetings. 

#### Google Doc Logs

Each member of the group will have a Google Doc-based log. This is where you should routinely provide updates on your work and progress (including links to any external materials).    You can leave questions for me within these documents. These will be regularly checked and commented on. 

#### Overleaf

For mathematical work, we will use shared Overleaf documents to enable collaborative. Manuscripts will typically be written in the form of Latex documents unless journal choice mandates the use of Microsoft Word.

#### Code repositories

You are advised to regularly store program codes and scripts in a code repository (e.g. Github).

### Slack

There is a Group Slack channel for instant messaging style communications. Use this to ask quick questions or drop me a thought that I can pick up later. However, if it is important, use your Google Doc as Slack messages will not be permanently stored.

### High-performance computing

The group has a share on the [BMRC](https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/for-staff/resources/bmrc) facility and group members can be added to access the system.
